<p> This is a map of highly suitable American badger, <i>(Taxidae taxus)</i>, habitat around Point Conception, California. <br>
</br>Data was downloaded from CWHR, California Wildlife Habitat Relationships, and clipped it to a Point Conception polygon. <br>
</br> The highly suitable habitat was determined by CWHR to have values of 0.66 - 1, and I reclassified these values as 1, and showed only these.</p>
